## üß© Architecture Components

| Service                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Gateway**        | Entry point for all API requests. Supports throttling, validation, and WAF. |
| **Lambda (Backend)**   | Stateless compute that processes incoming API requests.                     |
| **Lambda Authorizer**  | Custom token validation (JWT, OAuth2, etc.) before traffic reaches backend. |
| **Amazon Cognito**     | Optional user identity provider for token-based auth.                       |
| **Secrets Manager**    | Secure storage and rotation for API keys, DB creds, and tokens.             |
| **AWS WAF**            | Web Application Firewall rules to block common attacks.                     |
| **IAM Roles/Policies** | Define least-privilege access to APIs, Secrets, and Lambda.                 |
| **CloudWatch / X-Ray** | Logging, tracing, and metrics for observability and threat detection.       |
